This React Native code attempts to access a property of an object before checking if the object itself exists.  This is a common cause of runtime errors, particularly when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or user input.

```javascript
// Incorrect code
const userProfile = this.state.userProfile;
const userName = userProfile.name; // Error if userProfile is null or undefined
```
